    <h1>Fruits</h1>
    <h1>Fruits can be basically defined as the edible product of plant growth which can serve as food for 
        humans and animals. Fruits are important because they are an excellent source of essential 
        vitamins and minerals and they are high in fibre. Fruits are also said to provide a wide range
        of health-boosting antioxidants.
